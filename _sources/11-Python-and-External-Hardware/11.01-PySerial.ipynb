    "PySerial is a Python package that facilitates serial communication. A computer running Python with the PySerial package installed can communicate with external hardware.  PySerial is a useful package for problem solvers because it allows us to exchange data between computers and pieces of external hardware such as voltmeters, oscilloscopes, strain gauges, flow meters, actuators, and lights.\n",

Serial communication protocol predates the USB specification used by computers and other pieces of hardware like mice, keyboards, and webcams. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. USB and is built upon and extends the original serial communication interface."
